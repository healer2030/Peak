        <hr>

        <h2>Notice to Customers</h2>

        <p>
            At Peak Airlines ("Peak" or "we" or "us"), we respect your privacy. That is why we would like you to know
            what
            information about you may be collected when you use a Peak website (www.flypeak.com, www.peakairlines.com,
            their respective subdomains, and any other website owned, operated and/or controlled by Peak), the Peak
            mobile
            application and related mobile services, Peak's onboard wireless services, Peak's in-flight entertainment
            system or other services linking to this page (all, collectively, the "Peak Online Services"). We also want
            to
            make sure you understand how your information is protected, how it could be used, and our legal basis for
            doing so.
            Please take a moment to read the following questions and answers, which describe our online privacy and
            security
            practices in more detail.<b> By using the Peak Online Services, you agree to this policy and the practices
                it
                describes.</b> Peak reserves the right, at any time, to change this policy, in whole or in part, in its
            sole
            discretion. Please review this policy periodically to ensure you are aware of any changes and are familiar
            with the
            most current version.

        <h2> 1. What information do we collect?</h2>

        <p>
            When you use the Peak Online Services, your information and activity data is collected in several ways.
        </p>
        <h4>A. Information You Provide.</h4>
        <p>
            When you engage with certain Peak Online Services, we and our Service Providers (defined below), may collect
            information you provide directly via the Peak Online Services. For example (and this is not an exhaustive
            list),
            we collect information when you register with PeakPoints; book a flight, Peak Vacations package or make
            another
            travel booking; purchase merchandise; or sign up for a sweepstakes or other promotion. You also may be asked
            to
            provide information about where you like to travel or other information about your preferences and behavior.
            If you
            make a purchase of any kind, you may be asked to provide your credit card number, billing information and/or
            other
            payment information.

            The information we collect may include Personal Information. "Personal Information" is information that
            identifies
            you personally (whether alone or in combination), such as your first and last name, email address, phone
            number, and
            postal address. You may choose to voluntarily submit certain other information to us through the Peak Online
            Services, including Personal Information, but you are solely responsible for your own Personal Information
            in
            instances where we have not requested that you submit such information to us.
        </p>

        <h4>B. Information Collected Automatically.</h4>
        <p>
            When you use the Peak Online Services, some information about you and your online activity may be
            automatically
            collected through the use of servers and other technologies (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may
            include
            internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the internet, device identifier, browser
            type and
            version, operating system and platform, mobile device type, wireless carrier, data regarding network
            connected
            hardware, the average time you spent engaging with a Peak Online Service, pages viewed, information searched
            for,
            access times, geo-location information, and/or other statistics and information about your use of the Peak
            Online
            Service. To the extent that we combine Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat the
            combined
            information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.

            The methods that may be used on the Peak Online Service to collect Usage Information include:

            <ul>
                <li><b>Log Information:</b> Log information is data about your use of the Peak Online Service, such as
                    IP
                    address,
                    browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps,
                    and
                    related data, which is stored in log files.</li>
                <li><b>Information Collected by Tracking Technologies:</b> Cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking
                    pixels"), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, voice processing technologies, device
                    fingerprinting, in-app tracking methods, and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed
                    (“<b>Tracking Technologies</b>”) may be used to collect information about your interactions with the
                    Peak
                    Online
                    Service or emails, including information about your browsing and activity behavior. These tracking
                    technologies allow us to determine unique preferences and trends based on a visitor's use of the
                    Peak
                    Online Services, as well as that visitor's use of third party online services participating in the
                    same
                    advertising network as Peak.</li>
                <li><b>Cookies:</b> A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device, which may be a
                    session ID
                    cookie or tracking cookie. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Peak Online
                    Services
                    and expire when you close your browser. Tracking cookies help in understanding how you use the
                    Service, and
                    remain longer. The Peak Online Services may associate some or all of these types of cookies with
                    your
                    devices. Cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time.</li>
                <li><b>Web Beacons (“Tracking Pixels”):</b> Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as
                    "internet tags"
                    or "clear gifs," embedded in web pages and email messages. Web beacons may be used to count the
                    number of
                    visitors to the Peak Online Service, to monitor how users navigate the Peak Online Service, and to
                    count
                    content views.</li>
                <li><b>Embedded Scripts:</b> An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information
                    about your
                    interactions with the Peak Online Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our
                    web
                    server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Peak Online
                    Service, and deleted or deactivated thereafter.</li>
                <li><b>Location-identifying Technologies:</b> GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering,
                    and
                    other location-aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes such as verifying
                    your
                    location and delivering or restricting relevant content based on your location.</li>
                <li><b>Device Fingerprinting:</b> Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets
                    of
                    information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in
                    order to
                    create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and applications.</li>
            </ul>
            Please also note that most browsers have options that allow the visitor to control whether the browser will
            accept
            cookies, reject cookies, or notify the visitor each time a cookie is sent, but setting a browser to reject
            cookies
            will limit the range of features available to the visitor on our Peak Online Services, and rejecting or
            disabling
            cookies will not necessarily limit all forms of the Peak Online Services tracking technologies and
            methodologies.

        <h2>2. How do we use the information we collect?</h2>

        <P>
            We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties, and we use it only in accordance with this
            policy.
        </p>

        <p>
            We may use the information we collect about you (described above) for any purposes consistent with our
            statements under this privacy policy or as permitted by applicable law, including to complete transactions,
            respond to your requests, verify if a visitor meets any criteria in order to process a request, advertise,
            maintain and optimize the Peak Online Services, and notify you of promotions, updates or special offers,
            including Peak affiliate (like PeakPoints partner) offers, that we think may interest you. We also use your
            information to provide you with a more effective and personalized customer experience across all of our
            Peak Online Services and to serve you with advertisements and other information appropriate to you and
            your interests. We may also use your information off line to provide you services as well, including without
            limitation, customer service, in flight services, and booking services. For example, some of your
            information is collected so that when you visit a particular Peak Online Service more than once, the
            Peak Online Service will recognize you. We may also share the information we collect about you (including
            your Personal Information) with our parent, subsidiary or other affiliate entities without restriction.
        </p>

        <p>Peak and our ad management companies will use your information, such as browsing and other online
            activities, to target advertising to you while you are using Peak Online Services or other online
            services that we think will be of interest to you. Some of this advertising may be designed to bring you
            back to our Peak Online Services. Similarly, ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties
            may use Tracking Technologies on the Peak Online Services and Third Party Services to track your
            activities across time and services, and tailor ads to you based on your activities, which may include
            sending you an ad on a Third Party Service or third party device after you have left the Peak Online
            Services. </p>

        <p>
            In order to accomplish all of those things, we may process your information or combine it with other
            information that we have about you or that is publicly available, and we also may share your information
            with other companies that are carefully selected by Peak to assist in these uses. Please see "Could
            anyone
            other than Peak be collecting and using my information?" below for information on how these other
            companies may collect and use your information.
        </p>

        <p>
            To the extent permitted or required by applicable law, we may disclose Personal Information to US or non-US
            government authorities or agencies or other third parties pursuant to a law, rule or regulation, legal
            request, subpoena, or other legal process or requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may also use or disclose your information (including to third party companies) to perform charge
            verifications, report or collect debts owed, fight fraud, or protect the rights or property of Peak, our
            customers, our third-party service providers, our affiliate companies, our Peak Online Services or its
            users.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like your Personal Information removed from the Peak Online Services, please contact us at
            privacy@flypeak.com, and we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your request by removing your
            information from our marketing databases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please be aware that if you use the Peak Online Services after we make reasonable efforts to remove any
            of your Personal Information, Peak may again collect information about you and use it in the accordance
            with this policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Peak also may be required by law, rule, regulation or other legal process to retain certain information
            from users about their use of the Peak Online Services and/or flight information. Peak will retain all
            such information, and any user request for information removal shall not affect information retained for
            legal compliance.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>3. Legal Basis</h2>

        <p>
            Certain jurisdictions require a legal basis for collection and use of personal information. JetBlue’s legal
            bases include: (1) processing your personal information in order to fulfill our contractual obligation to
            you, including providing you with flights, for schedule change notifications, and to administer your
            PeakPoints account; (2) using and disclosing your personal information as required for legal compliance,
            including
            required disclosures to the TSA or other governmental agencies; (3) processing your personal information
            where we have a legitimate interest in doing so, such as to prevent fraud and improve our customer service;
            and (4) handling your personal information based on your consent, such as when you have agreed to receive
            marketing communications.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h2>4. Children</h2>
        <h4>What information is collected from children?</h4>
        <p>
            Peak's Online Services are targeted to a general audience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Peak does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13
            without verifiable parental consent. If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide personally
            identifiable information of any kind whatsoever. If a child provides us with personally identifiable
            information, a parent or legal guardian of that child may contact us to obtain that information and/or
            delete it from our records by sending an email to privacy@flypeak.com.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>5. Collected Information</h2>
        <h4>How is the information collected online protected?</h4>
        <p>We take reasonable precautions to keep all information obtained in connection with the Peak Online
            Services secure against unauthorized access and use, and we periodically review our security measures.</p>
        <p>
            When you affirmatively provide us with Personal Information such as your name, address, phone number, credit
            card information, travel details, etc. while registering with PeakPoints or making a reservation or engaging
            with a feature of the Peak Online Services, your information is encrypted and transferred over a secure
            connection, available on most internet browsers. You can tell if you are accessing a secure server when the
            padlock icon found in most browsers appears locked and the first characters of the Peak Online Service
            address change from "http" to "https." Please note that if you provide information outside of a secure
            server, Peak cannot guarantee that information is protected with appropriate safeguards. For example, do
            not use email to send us credit card, billing or other personally identifiable information, as email travels
            unencrypted and can be read by anyone who receives or intercepts it. Once your information reaches us, we
            store it behind a firewall, which is a security feature that is designed to block access to the information
            from outside of our network. Only Peak-authorized individuals and our approved third-party companies
            described in this policy are allowed to access your information.
        </p>

        <h2>6. TSA Secure Flight Screening</h2>
        <h4>Why am I asked to provide certain information for TSA Secure Flight screening, and how is this data used?
        </h4>
        <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screens all commercial airline customers and baggage.</p>
        <p>As part of TSA's mission to secure airports in the United States, TSA requires you to provide certain
            Personal Information, such as your full name, date of birth, and gender, for the purpose of watch list
            screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. section 114, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention
            Act of 2004 and 49 C.F.R parts 1540 and 1560. The TSA may also require you to provide certain Biometric
            Data, such as fingerprint scans and facial recognition data. You may also provide your Redress Number, if
            available. Failure to provide your full name, date of birth, gender or any other information required by TSA
            may result in denial of transport or denial of authority to enter the boarding area. TSA may share
            information you provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under its published system
            of records notice. For more on TSA privacy policies, or to review the system of records notice and the
            privacy impact assessment, please see the TSA web site at www.tsa.gov</p>
